Improve the idea (inefficient and hard to implement):

Use a stack (syncronize with locks) and put tasks that represent backtracking branches.
The threads from the workpool take tasks from there.

Things to fix:
- Stop all the threads after one finishes
- Find a way to stop threads starting after the solution number
- Table display
- *Try to optimise the while
