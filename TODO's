Improve the idea (inefficient si hard to implement):

Use a stack (syncronize with locks) and put tasks that represent backtracking branches.
The threads from the workpool take tasks from there.

Bugs:
- Stop all the threads after one finishes
- Find a way to stop threads starting after the solution number
